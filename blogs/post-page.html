        Red is a color usually associated with deep burning desire. Red shoes
        have been symbolic of many emotions throughout history - burning desire
        and vitality, courage and love, religion, and even more. Red shoes,
        which have been seen on the feet of ballerinas, aristocracy, popes, and
        pop stars, have sparked imaginations, stoked outbursts, and elicited
        mesmerizing and scandalous looks.<br /><br />
        From representing nobility to sin and now to representing feminism,
        here's a look at the timelessly significant journey of red shoes which
        have made substantial appearances throughout history.
      </p>
      <h3>17th century</h3>
      <p class="post-text">
        In the era of the Great Turbulence, red shoes indicated POWER AND
        NOBILITY, similar to Louboutins indicating wealth. This is evident,
        especially in France, where France&apos;s 17th-century King Louis XIV
        was seen posing with red heels in a painting. Heels demonstrated that
        the wearer was wealthy enough to avoid scuffing them up and strong
        enough to tramp down his foes. This meaning was emphasized more when the
        heel was in red.
      </p>

      <h3>18th century</h3>
      <p class="post-text">
        The 18th through 19th century was a dark era for red shoes. Red shoes
        were incorporated in books and films with not the best meaning. To pick
        an example from a popular story - What started as a seemingly normal
        fairytale around a girl named Karen was all fun until the girl manages
        to obtain red leather shoes. Her desire for something as simple as
        eye-catching footwear appears to be so grotesque that she is denigrated
        by an angel to dance herself to tragedy. Obviously enough, it does not
        make the best bedtime story. It's a horrifyingly macabre little story,
        made entirely of unsavory messages about vanity's punishment. This
        gruesome story was adapted somewhat around the similar plot of Kate
        Bush's 1993 album The Red Shoes.
      </p>

      <h3>Current Times</h3>
      <p class="post-text">
        The modern era has been the finest for red shoes, with them having the
        most positive and empowering meaning. Aside from being a bold fashion
        statement, it now also represents feminism and anti-femicide. The
        significance of red shoes was added by Elina Chauvet, who&apos;s known
        famously for her red shoes. According to an oft-cited statistic, on
        average, 10 women and girls are killed each day in Mexico. The artist
        emoted femicide by using red shoes representing the pain and passion to
        stop the terrible cause. Not just one, but thousands of pairs of red
        boots, heels, and toddler shoes were made by her. They are there since
        the women or girls who would have worn them no longer occupy any space
        other than in the lives of their loved ones. This movement was a result
        of Chauvet's “Los Zapatos Rojos” installation in cities around the
        world. This story tells the burning passion and beautiful yet sad
        meaning behind the mesmerizing and luxurious red shoes. Red had a lot of
        significance for Chauvet.
