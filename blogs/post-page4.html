        <b>What is domestic violence?</b><br />
        <u>Domestic abuse</u> also called &quot;domestic violence&quot; or
        &quot;intimate partner violence&quot;, can be defined as a pattern of
        behavior in any relationship that is used to gain or maintain power and
        control over an intimate partner. Abuse is physical, sexual, emotional,
        economic, or psychological actions or threats of actions that influence
        another person. This includes any behaviors that frighten, intimidate,
        terrorize, manipulate, hurt, humiliate, blame, injure, or wound someone.
        Domestic abuse can happen to anyone of any race, age, sexual
        orientation, religion, or gender. It can occur within a range of
        relationships including couples who are married, living together, or
        dating. Domestic violence affects people of all socioeconomic
        backgrounds and education levels.

        <b>Why is Domestic Violence an issue?</b><br />
        Domestic violence has a major impact on the general health and
        well-being of individuals. It is because it causes physical injury,
        anxiety, and depression. Moreover, it also impairs social skills and
        increases the likelihood that they will participate in practices harmful
        to their health, like self-harm or substance abuse.
      </p>

        <b>How does domestic violence affect a woman? </b><br />
        Domestic violence affects women in terms of ill health. It causes
        serious consequences on their mental and physical health which includes
        reproductive and sexual health. It also includes injuries, gynecological
        problems, depression, suicide, and more.<br /><br />
        Now there are some people who feel ashamed or maybe have the fear that
        something will go wrong if they open up. Below are some questions you
        need to ask yourself if you have any doubts about your situation:
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        <b>Am I Currently Being Abused or Have I Been Abused?</b><br />
        Sometimes discovering you are being abused may not be as black and white
        as the situation may initially seem. Most of the time, physical abuse is
        more straightforward to detect than mental abuse. However, it is
        necessary to point out that both are equally traumatic.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        <b>Ask yourself the <u>following questions</u> about your partner:</b
        ><br />
        > Do they often make fun of you in front of family and friends? <br />
        > Downplay your accomplishments?<br />
        > Make you feel stupid, less than, or not worthy or able to make
        decisions?<br />
        > Use intimidation or threats to gain compliance?<br />
        > Make statements like &quot;You&apos;re nothing without me&quot;?<br />
        > Act rough with you â€” such as hitting, pushing, or grabbing?<br />
        > Constantly call or text you and get aggravated when you don&apos;t
        respond right away?<br />
        > Trust issues like continually needing to know where you are and what
        you&apos;re doing?<br />
        > Pressure you sexually?<br />
        > Blame you for everything that doesn&apos;t go according to plan.<br />
        > Try to keep you isolated from friends and family?<br />
        > Make you feel like you cannot escape the relationship?
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        <b>Now, ask yourself the <u>following questions</u> about yourself:</b
        ><br />

        > Do you sometimes feel scared of how your partner is/will behave?<br />
        > Constantly make excuses for your partner&apos;s behavior?<br />
        > Avoid anything you may think would make your partner angry, even if it
        may be something you&apos;d enjoy?<br />
        > Always put your partner first, no matter what?<br />
        > Stay with your partner because you&apos;re scared of what they may do
        if you leave them?<br />

        <br />
        If you feel or experience any or a combination of the situations above,
        you may be experiencing abuse. Domestic violence tends to escalate, so
        if you see signs of abuse or believe you are being abused, it is vital
        to seek help and leave the relationship as soon as possible. Severe
        abuse cases can end in serious injury, or sometimes, death.

      <p class="post-text">
        <b>Recognizing the Triggers and Effects</b><br />
        Once you&apos;ve escaped your abuser, the abuse may still haunt you.
        Healing after experiencing domestic violence does not happen overnight,
        but it is possible. First, it&apos;s essential to recognize your
        <u>triggers and the effects</u> the abuse may still cause. These effects
        may range from difficulty sleeping and eating, panic attacks and
        anxiety, low self-esteem, and substance use. They can be triggered by
        memories or situations that may cause you to remember your abuser and/or
        the abuse. For example, if a particular bar or meal makes you think of
        your abuser, try to avoid it or any other triggers to minimize the
        effects.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        <b>Embrace Your New Freeing Life</b><br />
        Although you were abused, it&apos;s normal to feel sadness or
        loneliness, just as anyone may experience after a breakup. But it&apos;s
        important to stay positive and remind yourself that you are better off
        without that person. A great way to do this is by positively affirming
        yourself and staying active. <u>Positive affirmations</u> drive
        positivity and break the negativity that victims are used to hearing.
        Reminding yourself things such as &quot;I am worthy&quot;, &quot;I am
        enough&quot;, &quot;I love myself&quot;, and so on can help break the
        inner negativity you feel and help make yourself whole again.
        Furthermore, <u>staying active</u>, whether working out, taking daily
        walks, journaling, reading, arts and crafts, meditating, and more, can
        all keep your mind and body busy. This will help minimize the time you
        have to replay the trauma in your head constantly.
