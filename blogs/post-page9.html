        It was five decades ago that Norma McCorvey, more popularly known by her
        pseudonym Jane Roe, first took to stand in court against the
        then-District Attorney of Dallas County, Henry Wade, and challenged the
        criminal abortion laws in Texas. The practice, considered
        unconstitutional by the state except when the continuation of pregnancy
        to term posed a significant danger to the life of the mother, Roe only
        succeeded in legalising abortion in the U.S, in 1973, something that
        would come to be known as the Supreme court&apos;s landmark ruling.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Roe v. Wade was significant in the sense that the case accorded women
        the freedom of choice and the right to bodily autonomy - guaranteeing
        the right to abortion in the first trimester, some regulation as to such
        of the government in the second trimester, and a pretext of danger to
        life to enforce the right to abortion in the third trimester. More so,
        it was a noteworthy ruling that set the precedent for subsequent cases
        of abortion and stimulated a new interpretation of the law that had been
        concluded from Roe v. Wade, 1973.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Fast forward fifty years later- and we find ourselves facing a most
        unique predicament. The 21st century may well be the hearth where the
        fires of revolutionary technological, developmental and socio-economic
        changes are being tended, but the dissolution of abortion rights and the
        reversal of Roe v.Wade might just be a cold draft of air that threatens
        to extinguish our progress and set us back by five decades. <br /><br />

        Perhaps the premature leakage of a draft of the majority opinion of the
        Supreme court in May considering criminalising abortion rights may have
        made the reversal slightly less surprising and only imminent. But that
        is not to say the actual ruling enforced on the 24th of June, 2022 made
        the public any less wanting of answers to questions raised regarding the
        validity and integrity of fundamental rights, that of lawmaking itself
        as well as the place of politics and religion in the legal system.<br /><br />

        But to facilitate debate to the largest extent of these issues and more,
        it&apos;s necessary to turn the pages of history and take note of the
        factors facilitating the legalisation of abortion in 1973.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        <b>The legal reasoning behind legalising abortion in 1973:</b>
        <br /><br />
        Today, the press and media have come to widely perpetuate the idea of
        the American Bill of Rights across global borders. Diligent fans of
        court dramas and criminal thrillers are sure to know of it. But it is
        buried subtly under this Bill that seeks to extend the functionality of
        the American constitution by according civil rights and liberties to the
        citizens, that we have the ninth amendment- the seed to the ultimate
        outcome of the legalisation of abortion.
        <br /><br />
        The ninth amendment facilitated validity to the previous rights
        enumerated under the Bill and accredited their existence. But in doing
        so it also pointedly remarked that the Bill wasn&apos;t an exhaustive
        list, thereby claiming the existence of unenumerated rights- rights not
        explicitly mentioned within the Bill that couldn&apos;t be disparaged
        merely on the lack of their inclusion.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        The right to privacy soon came to be acknowledged as one of these
        unenumerated rights and was subsequently deemed broad enough to be held
        applicable to the ruling of Roe v Wade- in the sense that the right to
        terminate an unwanted pregnancy came to be seen as a private one, thus
        legalising abortion. <br /><br />

        The Supreme court claimed that this right could also be found in the
        fourteenth amendment whose liberty clause deemed abortion as but a
        private choice and enforcement of liberal autonomy
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        A bit of a stretch? Perhaps too broad of an interpretation? That's what
        two of the justices opposing the legalisation in the original Roe v Wade
        ruling of 7:2 thought so. And that's also what the overruling of Roe v
        Wade banked on-a too literal comprehension of the provisions of the
        constitution and the bill of rights. The Supreme Court claimed that
        there were no explicit mentions of "abortion rights" in either of these
        compilations and therefore based on the methodology of originalism,
        neither could abortion be acknowledged by the liberty clause, nor could
        it be legalised on the pretext of the right to privacy. <br /><br />

        A motion that was met with significant outrage and dissent with
        thousands taking to the streets to clamour for the right to bodily
        autonomy and abortion to be seen as a human right, one can't but be
        apprehensive of the validity and credibility of one's "fundamental"
        rights. For just as swiftly and heartlessly that the overruling of Roe v
        Wade triggered other states into action aligning to the Supreme
        court&apos;s abortion ban, who knows, such a "warm" welcome might be
        extended to the rest of one's rights!
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        <b>Law and Morality</b>
        What this means is that the process of law-making must be questioned.
        The law and the legal system are not just what is but what should be,
        inducing a need for morality to the hard and fast rules that are
        enforced by the system. <br />
        In terms of Roe v Wade, in particular, the reversal of the original
        ruling was based entirely on a different stance regarding the
        interpretation and application of existing amendments. Here the legal
        system and the law were simply what is rather than what they should be.
        The latter would essentially mean recognizing the need to protect
        abortion rights and guard them as constitutional since abortion becomes
        the direct manifestation of the right to bodily autonomy so long as the
        viability of the foetus is considered.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Are there not wider implications of the laws themselves that must be
        evaluated before initiating sweeping changes on the need to rectify an
        academic discrepancy? Surely it would only take a simple cost-benefit
        analysis to determine that the advantages of abortion rights greatly do
        or could come to with greater policy specifications- outweigh the
        detriments?<br /><br />

        <b>Law should</b> be receptive to the implications of continuing with an
        unwanted pregnancy- an obligation that may be thrust upon women by the
        manner of pure violence. It should recognize the psychological distress
        induced as a result of unwanted pregnancies, specifically in the case of
        teenage pregnancies- where one lacks the intellectual maturity to deal
        with the circumstances and is subject to social and physical challenges.
        It should recognize the rights that women hold over their bodies and by
        extension life and that they do hold constitutional significance.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Criminalising abortions would not guarantee that these would cease in
        numbers, only that the women still needing the practice would be forced
        to seek out fewer safe options.<br /><br />

        We must constantly strive to be the best that we can, be till the world
        reflects our collective ideals and this means embedding morality in law
        and thinking about what should be. It is as a consequence of this that
        the law should be allowed to be enforced and amended.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        <b> The place of politics and religion in the legal system - </b>

        The slogan “Separation of the church and state” could be clearly heard
        amongst the protesters following the Supreme court&apos;s ruling. And
        the reasoning behind the same is as such- the majority of the American
        population is largely Christian. And let's just say that religion
        doesn&apos;t exactly look upon abortion empathetically or something that
        should be encouraged.<br /><br />

        The undeniable connection of politics with the law thus puts one in a
        bit of a predicament when considering this Christian majority extend
        their democratic rights by voting for someone who represents their
        ideals i.e. someone who is Christian. While this is just the rightful
        exercise of the democratic rights of the citizens, what does get
        highlighted is the need of separating the church from the state. For one
        must consider the role religion and religious people play as part of the
        vote bank in influencing the decisions of the state. Who knows, the
        American decision might even permeate throughout the global scene and
        convince other conservative Christian countries to ban abortion.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        The law does not protect, punish, or guarantee rights exclusively to a
        particular religious or social group within any nation. It should not
        alter its form to perpetuate the opinions or beliefs of any particular
        social group, for one may be a majority or a minority, deeply religious
        or an atheist (with obvious diverse specifications) but in the end, the
        law affects us and responds to us in the same manner and is thus
        inherently equalising. This thus indicates the need to separate the
        church and the state, in order for the law to exist rightfully and treat
        all of its citizens in an equal manner.<br /><br />

        The Reversal of Roe v Wade has definitely given us all a lot to think
        about. It is pertinent to consider what this could mean not just for the
        validity of the rest of the fundamental rights, but also for the
        methodology of law making and our social interactions.
