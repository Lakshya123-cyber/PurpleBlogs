          The Nineteenth Century's Pride and Prejudice: An insight into Women's
          Rights

        The very first time I watched the famous film Pride and Prejudice four
        years ago, I assumed the storyline to only revolve around an anonymous
        figure of a rich, single man. However, this misconception was dispelled
        once I thoroughly read the novel a few months back, only to realise it
        is concerned with the plight of a poor, single woman. For the past three
        centuries, women&apos;s rights have been a hotly debated and significant
        issue. Pride and Prejudice, a work of literary fiction by Jane Austen,
        is well-known and highly regarded for its controversial yet
        comprehensive ideas and viewpoints on female liberties and feminist
        roles.

        It could be challenging for contemporary readers to comprehend the
        significance of marriage in the lives of Elizabeth Bennet and her
        sisters, who are characters in the book. Today's young women have a wide
        range of alternatives available to them when it comes to their future:
        they can marry, of course, but they can also attend college, pursue any
        job route that may interest them, and live independently of family
        members or chaperones. Young women in Austen&apos;s time did not have
        access to these benefits. The girls of the middle and upper classes were
        allowed to attend school, but their education there focused more on
        <b>accomplishment</b> than it did on broadening their academic
        knowledge.

        &quot;Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
        wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
        read and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
        idle, certainly might.&quot; This was a statement quoted by Elizabeth
        Bennet in the novel. A bright, inquisitive young lady like Elizabeth
        Bennet would have naturally been able to extend her knowledge on her own
        through reading. She describes her and her sisters&apos; education as
        being accessible but unstructured, where Fitzwilliam Darcy, her lover,
        concomitantly points out that a truly admirable woman will develop her
        mind through substantial reading.

        Apart from educational differences, the social and economic expectations
        of women in nineteenth-century England were illustrated through Jane
        Austen&apos;s depictions of various perspectives on distinct attitudes
        and expectations concerning love and marriage. Even though the novel
        featured a variety of characters and viewpoints, Austen&apos;s female
        protagonists were frequently encouraged to focus on and strive for
        marriage. Women&apos;s lives were meaningless and could only be
        completed by marrying upper-class men and achieving financial security.
        The relationship between the characters Charlotte and Mr. Collins is one
        of the first ones in the novel that fits into this category. While
        rejecting any romantic impulses, Charlotte marries Mr. Collins
        exclusively out of mercenary self-interest. Jane Austen also depicted
        this in a line from her book, &quot;solely from the pure and
        disinterested desire of an establishment&quot;, marking marriage as the
        &quot;pleasantest preservative from want&quot;.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Even though there were many issues faced regarding love and marriage in
        the 19th century, Austen brings out themes of feminism and empowerment
        of women with the beautiful portrayal of Elizabeth&apos;s character.
        Elizabeth rejects Darcy&apos;s initial proposal to her because it lacks
        heart and sincerity and seems like he is just settling with her. She
        understands that by doing so, she would be placing herself in a marriage
        that would resemble that of her parents, who would be unhappy and
        lacking in mutual respect. This concept put her happiness first rather
        than her wealth and social standing, which was the antithesis of the
        prevailing ideas at the time!

        <br /><br />
        A girl or young woman today is discouraged or denied when she expresses
        a desire to do something or want anything by being told that she is
        <b
          >&quot;too young&quot;, &quot;too old&quot;, or &quot;she doesn&apos;t
          know anything!&quot;</b
        >
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        When you look at Elizabeth in her past, you see a young woman who was
        subject to even stricter limitations. Yet she exuded confidence. She was
        witty and intelligent. A beautiful girl distinguished by her wit and
        lighthearted humour. A young lady who acknowledged her mistakes. Being
        flawless is a fantasy. Jane Austen had depicted her as a modern lady who
        aspires to be a strong independent female. A woman who was capable of
        taking care of herself despite being conscious of her flaws.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        After much research and reading this book, I&apos;d like to draw a
        conclusion that ties into the concept of contemporary feminism and
        women&apos;s rights: Young girls and women who can speak up and who
        aren&apos;t meant to be ideal but rather <b>real</b> are what we need. A
        flawed but reasonable, logical, and morally upright lady. A woman who is
        always eager for improvement.

        The fundamental message of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is that
        marriages should be based on <i>physical attraction and love</i> rather
        than ensuring a husband's financial security or having women raise the
        heir to his riches or legacy. She expresses her political views and
        wants her readers to understand the lack of equality women were
        receiving. Jane Austen uses the depiction of the Bennet siblings and
        their various viewpoints on romance and marriage to highlight the social
        and economic inequality of women in nineteenth-century England.
