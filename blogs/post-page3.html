          Rape Culture: Conceding to the reality of society

        <i
          >A United Nations statistical report compiled from the government
          sources of 65 countries revealed that more than 250,000 cases of
          rape/attempted rape were recorded by police annually.</i
        >
        The number provided above covers only the &quot;reported cases&quot;
        while in reality, this number is quite high, as many victims are scared
        to come out with their assault stories for they won&apos;t be believed
        and the onus of the crime would somehow be put on them.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        This fear is not futile. Around every corner of the world, a culture
        exists that is intoxicating the lives of the victims and threatening
        them to behave submissively and confirm the century-old patriarchal
        rules. Unfortunately and unknowingly we become the propagators of this
        tradition, which is quite reflective in our behaviors and actions. For
        example,
        <b
          >Victim-blaming, Slut-shaming, Denial of widespread rape under false
          accusations, and sexual objectification</b
        >
        are the kinds of behaviors portrayed toward victims.

      <h3>THE POINTING FINGERS</h3>
      <p class="post-text">
        &quot;She was wearing such short clothes. Nowadays, girls dress
        indecently and then expect men to not get excited? Such whores!&quot;,
        <br /><br />
        &quot;Hey, she is a prostitute. I mean that&apos;s her work! Maybe she
        wants some extra money from the client, that&apos;s why she is accusing
        him of rape!&quot;,
        <br /><br />
        &quot;She wants to become the boss, that&apos;s her tactic of stealing
        that position!&quot;,<br /><br />
        &quot;Look, she hangs out with boys, laughs out so loudly with them.. it
        would be no surprise if something happens with her, she is clearly
        sending signals.&quot;<br /><br />
        All of us at some point or another have heard or even said these things
        for the victims. Victim blaming the survivor legitimizes and excuses the
        crime that should be considered inexcusable. Victim blaming instills the
        fear of judgment and mistrust in people who survived abuse so much so
        that they continue to bear the trauma alone or have suicidal ideation.
      </p>
      <h3>MEANS OF PROMOTING RAPE CULTURE</h3>
      <p class="post-text">
        Regrettably, the conservative mindsets and media have largely indulged
        in promoting the rape culture. Here&apos;s how.
      </p>
      <h3>REVENGE PORN</h3>
      <p class="post-text">
        Revenge porn is when a person&apos;s explicit photos/videos are uploaded
        on the internet <b>without their consent</b> generally by an intimate
        partner to blackmail the person to perform sexual acts on-demand, come
        into a relationship, or punish them for not doing/behaving a certain
        way.<br />
        Such images are largely available on the internet and direct the message
        to the viewers that an excusable way to blackmail a person into doing
        something is to rape and film them.
      </p>
      <h3>MOVIES</h3>
      <p class="post-text">
        Films have a strong influence on the minds of people. Fans, including
        small children, imitate the role and ideologies of their favorite
        actors. This mandates the accountability and responsibility on part of
        filmmakers, actors, writers, producers, and censor boards to be vigilant
        enough about the content they are putting out for the audience.<br /><br />
        Movies and dramas including renowned Thai-drama Tra Barb See Chompoo,
        Praomook; popular K-Dramas like Boys over Flowers, Playful Kiss; animes;
        Bollywood movies like Kabir Singh, Dabbang, and many others at various
        scenes incorporate casual sexism, misogyny, along with normalizing
        assaults, stalking and men forcing themselves upon women to legitimize
        their toxicity under the garb of showing love. Movies and series like
        them dismiss the concept of CONSENT at large and direct the audience
        towards the wrong path.
      </p>

      <h3>SONGS</h3>
      <p class="post-text">
        &quot;I don&apos;t really care how long you&apos;ve been together with
        your man. It&apos;s just a matter of time before I make you mine. I
        wanna make it clear so there&apos;s no misunderstandings, that I get
        what I want, when I want.&quot; [If I Want To by Usher 2001]
        <br /><br />
        &quot;I&apos;ll scream with you: Ah! somebody help! Don&apos;t you get
        it b**ch? No one can hear you. Now shut the f***k up, and get
        what&apos;s coming to you. You were supposed to love me, now bleed,
        b**ch , bleed.&quot; [Kim by Eminem 2000]<br /><br />
        There is no conflict that women indeed are in a lamentable state for
        they have always been sexualized. They have always been seen as an
        object to attain sexual desires by men, and if they dare say NO, the
        punishment is Rape.<br /><br />
        Songs like them are impacting the mindset of people including young boys
        who might grow up inculcating this toxic ideology.
      </p>

      <h3>LEARNED SEXISM AND TOXICITY</h3>
      <p class="post-text">
        Parents, grandparents, teachers, and other adults that child has direct
        contact with, do influence tender minds in addition to media. The sexism
        prevalent in homes and schools unknowingly gets instilled so deeply in
        children that they might foster the contaminating patriarchal mindsets
        and misogyny and in turn harm society. Children growing up in a
        traditional conservative patriarchal family, from a young state, start
        to employ the feeling of envy and disgust for girls and women out there
        who try to break the societal laws and live lives on their terms. For
        example, many times we have come across this line: &quot;You cannot
        work. No woman in my family ever worked! I won&apos;t allow you.
        It&apos;s a matter of pride for us. We cannot allow a woman in our
        family to work outside. If you want to work, work in the house, do
        household chores, who is stopping you?&quot; (A classic instance of
        inherited patriarchy!)

        <br /><br />

        Additionally, at school, moral policing girls for wearing skirts above
        the knee, having friendships with boys, or sexualizing them for periods
        promote gender disparity in a place that should be equal for everyone.
        Saying things like “Your skirt is very short! Are you trying to attract
        boys?” incorporates self-guilt in women as they think it was their fault
        that they were assaulted.

        <br /><br />

        It thus becomes more crucial to impart sex education from an early
        stage, censor the content that can promote rape culture, promote mindful
        parenting and create a safe space for every gender be it a woman, man,
        bi-sexual, gender fluid, pansexual, or others. Every one of us shall
        remember that this culture is propagated by us and we are the ones who
        can stop it. After all,
        <i>Change begins at the end of your comfort zone</i>.
