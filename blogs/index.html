          Red is a color usually associated with deep burning desire. Red shoes

          Rape Culture: Conceding to the reality of society

        <p class="post-description">
          A United Nations statistical report compiled from the government
          sources of 65 countries revealed that more than 250,000 cases of
          rape/attempted rape were recorded by police annually. The number
          provided above covers only the &quot;reported cases&quot; while in
          reality, this number is quite high, as many victims are scared to come
          out with their assault stories for they won&apos;t be believed and the
          onus of the crime would somehow be put on them.

          Domestic abuse also called &quot;domestic violence&quot; or

          behavior in any relationship that is used to gain or maintain power
          and control over an intimate partner.

          The Nineteenth Century's Pride and Prejudice: An insight into Women's

        <p class="post-description">
          The very first time I watched the famous film Pride and Prejudice four
          years ago, I assumed the storyline to <b>only</b> revolve around an
          anonymous figure of a rich, single man. However, this misconception
          was dispelled once I thoroughly read the novel a few months back, only
          to realise it is concerned with the plight of a poor, single woman.

          How to utilize Psychological healing to deal with abuse

        <p class="post-description">
          That natural state of undivided wholeness and nonjudgmental
          unconditional acceptance of our feelings is the basis of psychological
          healing. The best way to heal emotionally painful inner conflict is to
          stop resisting, controlling, censoring, judging, or interpreting our
          painful or uncomfortable feelings.

          Domestic Violence Against Women: Recognizing early signs which would
          help prevent abuse
        </a>
        <span class="post-date">5 Aug 2022</span>
        <p class="post-description">
          Domestic violence is quickly traversing across national boundaries as
          well as socio-economic, cultural, racial, and class distinctions. Its
          incidence is also extensive, making it seem an accepted behavior.
          Domestic violence has serious impacts on women's health and well-being
          and its continued existence is morally indefensible. Yet this major
          problem has been so widely ignored and so little understood.
