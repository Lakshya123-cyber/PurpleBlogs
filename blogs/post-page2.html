        10 year old Jivika would&apos;ve never recognized the flaws her
        “favourite rom-com” had until she became an avid researcher once she
        turned 17. Hi, I'm Jivika, a student in singapore, and a not so proud
        DDLJ fan once I started collating data for this article. Let's start off
        with my used to be favourite rom com.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        &quot;Maine apko kahin dekha hai&quot; <br />
        &quot;Yeh Joh apki ankhen hai&quot; says Shahrukh Khan while getting
        uncomfortably close to Kajol, in one of the famous train scenes in a
        &quot;Bollywood classic&quot; Dil Wale Dhulhaniya Le Jayenge or more
        popularly known as &quot;DDLJ&quot;. <br />
        It is just another movie depicting the true ideal: harass her till she
        says yes. This particular scene is displayed as &quot;flirty&quot; while
        we can clearly see Kajol uncomfortable as she also mentions multiple
        times, &quot;Please leave me alone!&quot;<br />
        This &quot;flirty&quot; nature is now promoted among many young men in
        India and thus these cases of real-life harassment are either overlooked
        or just another taunt at the victim. I truly apologise for ruining one
        of your childhood memories but in Demi Lovato&apos;s quote: Sorry not
        Sorry, and I&apos;ll continue to shatter a few more.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Now before calling me out and labelling me as a &quot;woke Indian&quot;
        by mentioning &quot;please stop ruining DDLJ with your cringeworthy 2020
        opinion&quot; as one of the most reputed Indian media outlet The Print
        mentioned and of course provided justification of the scene, saying the
        motivation behind it was &quot;to paint flawed, but human
        characters&quot;, so hear me out and let me describe multiple scenes
        from different movies; the real-life influence of such movies on the
        youth of India and their outstanding promotion of harassment
        normalisation. Now one fact I hope my readers and I can agree upon is
        the portrayal of harassment is subtle and &quot;cute&quot; in these
        movies. It is even romanticized to the extent that the naked human eye
        can see bacteria on food but not the harassment.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Let's take another example from 2019, not a classic but definitely a
        blockbuster: “Kabir Singh”. It is the pioneer in normalizing an abusive
        relationship. When Sandeep Reddy the director asked the question about
        our protagonist Kabir slapping Preeti he responded, I kid you not, that
        the physical demonstration is symptomatic of being vested in a
        relationship. <br />He said that women who found this portrayal
        offensive haven't experienced this &quot;kind of love&quot; and have
        probably never loved. Do you see some jarring offensive comments here?
        Not convinced yet? Let&apos;s take a look at an even more recent movie,
        Love Aaj Kal released in 2020 in which Imtiaz Ali has taken the liberty
        to create a glorified montage of stalking the second the film opens,
        Kartik Aryan follows around Sara Ali Khan, and Aarushi Gupta in two
        different love stories in different timelines.<br />
        For the film whose purpose was to display modern romance we can, safely
        say that it has miserably failed due to an orthodox director with an
        even more orthodox approach which is reflected in its apt IMDB score of
        4.6/10. At least such an IMBD score represents to an extent that while
        stalker behavior might still be the norm on the reel, the Indian
        audience is evolving past it in real life. Similarly Raanjhnaa where a
        school boy stalks a school girl and they eventually fall in love. A
        little spoiler alert for you who are planning to adopt a similar
        approach - women do not like being followed. Now you might say what is
        the evidence that even if such movies are created they have the power to
        influence an individual?
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Well, unfortunately, there is more than sufficient evidence to support
        this, a 32-year-old Indian man in Australia was accused of stalking two
        women one for 18 months and another for 4 months. He escaped conviction
        on the grounds of &quot;cultural Bollywood influence&quot; Still not
        convinced? Well, let me remind you of a basic slang thrown around by
        avid Bollywood fans and maybe even you without realising its meaning,
        &quot;Item song&quot;, &quot;Item girl&quot;, - objectifying women at
        its finest reducing them to mere &quot;items&quot; for the male gaze.
        This term is thrown around for any Bollywood song depicting a sensuous
        sexy woman dancing around multitudes of men.<br />
        Calling her an item, does it ring a bell now? I hope it does because as
        a society unless we don&apos;t change, we don&apos;t hold popular
        directors, writers, and actors accountable,harassment will find its way
        to our cinemas and OTT platforms. <br /><br />
        My sincere request is to continue watching and enjoying Bollywood movies
        as many of them created a positive impact on our Indian society and have
        been catalysts in transforming some of our outdated mindsets. However,
        be aware and try raising your voice, or take small steps - by sharing
        low ratings and critical reviews on such movies. This ought to notify
        our content creators that we are not &quot;cringeworthy youth of
        2022&quot; but well-informed, original creative not-so-misogynistic
        content consumers.
