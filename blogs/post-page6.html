        That natural state of undivided wholeness and nonjudgmental
        unconditional acceptance of our feelings is the basis of psychological
        healing. The best way to heal emotionally painful inner conflict is to
        stop resisting, controlling, censoring, judging, or interpreting our
        painful or uncomfortable feelings.

        If you know or suspect that someone is a victim of domestic violence,
        you might feel clueless about the best way to help. Don't let a fear of
        saying the wrong thing prevent you from reaching out.

        <b>How to help:</b><br />
        <b>Make Time for Them</b> - If you decide to reach out to an abuse
        victim, do so during a time of calm.<br />
        <b>Start a Conversation</b> - You can bring up the subject of domestic
        violence by saying &quot;I am worried about you because...&quot; or
        &quot;I am concerned about your safety...&quot; or &quot;I have noticed
        some changes that concern me...&quot;<br /><br />
        Let the person know that you will be discreet about any information
        disclosed.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        <b>Listen Without Judgement</b><br />
        If the person does decide to talk, listen to the story without being
        judgmental, offering advice, or suggesting solutions. Chances are if you
        actively listen, the person will tell you exactly what they need.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        <b>Validate the Victim's Feelings </b><br />
        It's not unusual for victims to express conflicting feelings about their
        partner and their situation. These feelings can range from:<br />
        > Guilt and Anger<br />
        > Hope and Despair<br />
        > Love and Fear <br /><br />

        If you want to help, it is important that you validate her feelings by
        letting her know that having these conflicting thoughts is normal. But
        it is also important that you confirm that violence is not okay, and it
        isn't normal to live in fear of being physically attacked.
