          help prevent abuse

        Domestic violence is quickly traversing across national boundaries as
        well as socio-economic, cultural, racial, and class distinctions. Its
        incidence is also extensive, making it seem an accepted behavior.
        Domestic violence has serious impacts on women's health and well-being
        and its continued existence is morally indefensible. Yet this major
        problem has been so widely ignored and so little understood.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Domestic violence is not always as obvious as you might think.
        That&apos;s because domestic abuse is about controlling someone&apos;s
        mind and emotions as much as hurting their body. It can be hard for you
        to see your partner&apos;s actions for what they really are. Usually,
        physical abuse isn&apos;t what comes first. The abuse creeps up slowly
        through verbal harassment. A putdown here or there. An odd excuse to
        keep you away from family or friends, or make you ask for an OK to see
        friends and family. Controlling your dressing sense, while keeping a tab
        on every person you interact with, or criticizing you for meeting people
        you are comfortable with. Sometimes, abusers embarrass you in front of
        people you love and respect, implicitly forcing you to avoid people in
        general. This technique often makes you feel less worthy of yourself and
        vulnerable, after which the violence often ramps up since you&apos;ve
        been cut off from other people. By then, you feel trapped.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Often, abusers attempt to control your money, putting you on an
        &quot;allowance&quot; and ensuring every dollar you spend is with their
        consent. This essentially makes you dependent on your partner for basic
        necessities like food and clothing and even getting medical care. An
        attempt of &quot;disobedience&quot; on your side leads to yelling,
        throwing punches at walls, and making you feel smaller to them.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Every woman is still not aware of sexual abuse. <b>CONSENT</b> is
        essential. If a man forces you to have sex, despite your resistance, it
        is considered abuse, no matter what your relationship status is. Forcing
        you to dress in a sexual way and making you feel obliged to have sex
        with them are all forms of domestic abuse.<br /><br />
        If you&apos;re afraid of your partner, that&apos;s a big red flag. You
        may be scared to say what you think, to bring up certain topics, or say
        no to sex. No matter the reason, fear has no place in a healthy
        relationship.<br /><br />
        If you feel like you&apos;re being abused, there&apos;s a good chance
        you may be, and it&apos;s worth getting help.
